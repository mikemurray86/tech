I have been working with techonology for over a decade and have enjoyed focusing on infrastructure automation and refining DevOps processes. Recently I have been specializing in securing systems and
processes from the ever shifting risks that we all face everyday. This site will serve as a reference for the various things I am researching or and novel ideas that I have come across in my travels.
